## Bubble Sort
### Best Case
* The best case scenario for Bubble Sort's passes would be n-1 because it disregards the last index. Also, Bubble Sort swaps two at a time, so the best scenario for the comparisons would be the same as the worst scenario for the comparisons because bubble checks through the entire array each time and on repeat.    
### Worst Case
<<<<<<< HEAD
* The worst case scenario for Bubble Sort would be if the list is sorted in descending order.
=======
* The worst case scenario for Bubble Sort's passes would be n-1 as well because like the best case scenario, it disregards the last index. Also, Bubble Sort swaps two at a time, so the worst case for the comparisons would be the same as the best scenario for the comparisons because bubble checks through the entire array each time and on repeat.

## Selection Sort
### Best Case
* The best case scenario for Selection Sort's passes would be n-1 because it disregards the last index. Also, Selection Sort selects and moves, so the best scenario for the comparisons would be the same as the worst scenario for the comparisons because the function goes through the same iteration of selecting through each value in the array and placing it in its appropriate location. 
### Worst Case

Also, Selection Sort selects and moves, so the worst scenario for the comparisons would be the same as the best scenario for the comparisons because the function goes through the same iteration of selecting through each value in the array and placing it in its appropriate location. 

## Insertion Sort
### Best Case
* The best case scenario for Insertion Sort's passes would be n-1 because it disregards the last index. Also, Insertion Sort inserts the value where appropriate, so the best scenario for the comparisons would be the values in ascending order from left to right because the function checks for each index only once and moves on to the next one, only making n-1 comparisons.  
### Worst Case
<<<<<<< HEAD
*
=======
* The worst case scenario for Insertion Sort's passes would be n-1 because it disregards the last index. Also, Insertion Sort inserts the value where appropriate, so the worst scenario for the comparisons would be the values in the reverse order or descending order from left to right because the function will check the entire array each time it goes through a pass, resulting in the maximum number of comparisons.
